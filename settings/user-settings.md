# User Settings

## Time Zone

Each user can choose the time zone for which to display dates and times. By default, this is based off of your web browser, but you can select which time zone you want to use. If you move to a different geographical region then you will want to update this setting.

The date/time displayed will depend on your selected time zone. For example, if a project is created at 4:30 pm EST by someone located on the east coast of the United States \(_America/New\_York_\), that same time would be shown as 1:30 pm PST for someone on the west coast \(_America/Los\_Angeles_\).

All dates and times in BidUnity will be shown to you in your selected time zone.

## Units Display

Part sizes/quantities can be shown in different units of measure. Lengths, areas, and volumes can be shown in metric \(millimeters\) or imperial \(inches\), with imperial supporting many different styles for fractions. The [purchase type](../system-configurations/part.md#purchase-types) for a part determines whether the part size is a length, area, volume, or per unit.

Each user can choose from the following units of measure for displaying lengths:

* Millimeters \(mm\)
* Decimal Inches \(i.e. 5.25"\)
* Inches with fractions: 16ths UNREDUCED \(i.e. 4/16"\)
* Inches with fractions: 16ths \(i.e. 3/16" or 1/4"\)
* Inches with fractions: 32nds \(i.e. 3/32" or 1/4"\)
* Inches with fractions: 64ths \(i.e. 3/64" or 1/4"\)
* Inches with fractions: 32nds shown as 16ths \(allows decimals in numerator, i.e. 12.5/16"\)
* Inches with fractions: 64ths shown as 16ths \(allows decimals in numerator, i.e. 11.25/16"\)

This selection determines how all lengths are displayed in BidUnity, but also affects areas and volumes for things like glass and caulking. The table below shows the unit of measure used for different part sizes:

| Dimension | Metric | US / Imperial |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Length | Millimeters \(mm\) | Inches \(may also show feet\) |
| Area | Square meters \(sq m\) | Square feet \(sq ft\) |
| Volume | Milliliters \(mL\) | Fluid Ounces \(oz\) |

### Differences between Stock Lengths and Cut Lengths

If a US/imperial format is chosen, the display for sizes varies for full stock lengths vs. cut lengths. Stock lengths larger than 1 foot will show a combination of feet with inches, whereas cut sizes are always shown in inches. If a metric format is chosen then lengths are always shown in millimeters.

### Project Settings Override

Each project contains it's own selection for unit of measure. Users can choose to display sizes in the project's unit of measure or their own user's unit of measure.
