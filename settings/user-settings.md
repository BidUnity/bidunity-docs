# User Settings

## Name, Email & Phone

You can view and change your name and phone number from your profile. If you want to change your email address, please email support@bidunity.com

## Time Zone

Each user can choose the time zone for which to display dates and times. By default, this is based off of your web browser, but you can select which time zone you want to use. If you move to a different geographical region then you will want to update this setting.

The date/time displayed will depend on your selected time zone. For example, if a project is created at 4:30 pm EST by someone located on the east coast of the United States \(_America/New\_York_\), that same time would be shown as 1:30 pm PST for someone on the west coast \(_America/Los\_Angeles_\).

All dates and times in BidUnity will be shown to you in your selected time zone.

## Units Display

Part sizes/quantities can be shown in different units of measure. Lengths, areas, and volumes can be shown in metric \(millimeters\) or imperial \(inches\), with imperial supporting many different styles for fractions. The [purchase type](../system-configurations/part.md#purchase-types) for a part determines whether the part size is a length, area, volume, or per unit.

Each user can choose from the following units of measure for displaying lengths:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Unit of Measure</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Examples</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Millimeters</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">20.3 mm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Decimal Inches</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">5.25&quot;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Inches with fractions: 16ths UNREDUCED</p>
        <p><em>(this is the only fraction format that is unreduced)</em>
        </p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">4/16&quot;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Inches with fractions: 16ths</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">3/16&quot; or 1/4&quot;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Inches with fractions: 32nds</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">3/32&quot; or 1/4&quot;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Inches with fractions: 64ths</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">3/64&quot; or 1/4&quot;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Inches with fractions: 32nds shown as 16ths</p>
        <p><em>(allows decimals in the numerator)</em>
        </p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">12.5/16&quot;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Inches with fractions: 64ths shown as 16ths</p>
        <p><em>(allows decimals in the numerator)</em>
        </p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">11.25/16&quot;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

This selection determines how all lengths are displayed in BidUnity, but also affects areas and volumes for things like glass and caulking. The table below shows the unit of measure used for different part sizes:

| Dimension | Metric | US / Imperial |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Length | Millimeters \(mm\) | Inches \(may also show feet\) |
| Area | Square meters \(sq m\) | Square feet \(sq ft\) |
| Volume | Milliliters \(mL\) | Fluid Ounces \(oz\) |

Fractions are reduced where possible. For example, `4/16"` would be reduced and displayed as `1/4"`. The only format that is NOT reduced is _16ths UNREDUCED_, which will always have 16 in the denominator.

### Display for Inches

If a US/imperial format is chosen, the display for sizes differs for full stock lengths vs. cut lengths.

Stock lengths may be shown in a combination of feet and inches. For example: `9' 4-5/16"`. If a stock or total length is a whole number of feet, then it is shown as with the "ft" units, such as `9 ft`.

Cut lengths are shown only in inches. For example: `102-5/16"`.

### Project Settings Override

Each project contains it's own selection for unit of measure. Users can choose to display sizes in the project's unit of measure or their own user's unit of measure.
