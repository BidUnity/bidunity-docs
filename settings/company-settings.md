# Company Settings

Only company admins can access and change the company settings. A company admin can change the user type for any user in their company.

## Company Users

You can add and remove users from your company. You can also change a user's type and assign permissions.

User types:

* **Standard User** - can perform all normal estimating activities and can view all of your company's projects.
* **Field/Shop Worker** - can only access projects for which they have been scheduled to work on from the calendar. These users are meant to mainly use the mobile app for iPhone/Android that allows for tracking time by clocking in and out of projects and activities.
* **Company Admin** - can change company settings, in addition to all of the capabilities of a Standard user.

User roles:

* **Timesheet Admin** - this is the only user role supported at this time, which allows the user to review and approve time recorded to projects for all users in your company.

## Vendors & Multipliers

Select the vendors from which your company buys materials, and set the product multipliers for your company. Your vendors and multipliers will be used to generate pricing for proposals. If you do not find the vendor you're looking for, you can [request a vendor to be added](mailto:support@bidunity.com?subject=Request%20for%20a%20vendor%20to%20be%20added&body=Please%20include%20the%20vendor%20name,%20address,%20phone%20number,%20and%20website%20%28if%20available%29), or you can create a new vendor.

## Margin Schedule

Set your company's preferred margins based on your costs for a bid. Margins apply for each type of work and can always be adjusted within each proposal, but they will default to the values defined here for new proposals.

## Proposal Settings

Change the display of the proposals that you create. These apply to everyone in your company.

#### **Cost Breakdown**

Choose how much cost detail you want to display in your proposals. You can show a detailed breakdown by account category for materials, labor, and overhead. Or you can display a single lump sum number for the total cost.

#### **Labor Method**

Choose the default way to calculate labor costs for proposals. Hourly labor can be attached to parts in different ways, creating estimates down to the smallest detail. Or use a simple cost per square foot. This can be changed in each proposal. You can check the part labor in the system configurations.

#### **Labor Rates**

Set the default rates per hour and per square foot for your shop and field labor. The appropriate rate will be used based on the labor method selected above. These rates can be changed in proposals.

#### **Notes**

Set the default notes that will be included for all proposals created for your company. The notes for each proposal can be changed individually, but the text here will be used by default.

#### **Sections to Display**

Show or hide information on the proposals that your company sends out.

* Schedule of Values
* Product Files
* Labor Durations

## Terms & Conditions

Change the terms and conditions used in the proposals that your company creates. Any changes made will only affect future proposals.

## Calendar Settings

The built-in calendar lets you schedule your users on projects. You can customize the colors used to represent your company's users on the calendar. The colors chosen will apply for everyone in your company.

You can also synchronize your BidUnity calendar to your Google Calendar. Use this section to setup the calendar sync. Each user in your company can be setup to sync to their own Google Calendar. This means that when an event is created/updated/deleted in the BidUnity calendar, the change will also appear on the synched Google Calendar for that user.
