# Company Settings

Only company admins can access and change the company settings. A company admin can change the user type for any user in their company.

## Company Users

You can add and remove users from your company. You can also change a user's type and assign permissions.

User types:

* **Standard User** - can perform all normal estimating activities.
* **Field/Shop Worker** - can only access projects for which they have been scheduled to work on from the calendar. These users have limited acess to the projects and proposals, and are meant to use mainly the mobile app for iPhone/Android that allows for tracking time by clocking in and out of projects and activities.
* **Company Admin** - can change company settings, in addition to all of the capabilities of a Standard user.

Roles:

* **Timesheet Admin** - this is the only role supported at this point, which allows the user to review and approve time recorded to projects for all users in your company.
