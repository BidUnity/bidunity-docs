# Door Frames

### Door Frame Components

The door frame contains a set of door components that are available to be selected when a door is inserted into an elevation drawing. The following types of door components are supported:

* Jamb
* Mullion
* Door Head
* Threshold
* Sweep
* Transom Jamb
* Transom Mullion
* Transom Door Head
* Transom Frame Head
* Transom Glass

The left and right sides of the door frame can be set separately.

### Door Frame Selectors

Doors have the ability to modify nearby parts when included in an elevation. Selectors allow relevant components and parts to be deleted for the door to be inserted.

For example, you may want to delete parts with 

* Horizontal Perimeter Head
* Horizontal Perimeter Sill
* Horizontal Intermediate Above to Head
* Left Vertical Component
* Right Vertical Component

### Sub-Frame

Door frames can be configured to be a sub-frame, which displaces the regular mullion/jamb components. Regular door frames do not displace the mullion/jamb components.

Sub-frames cannot contain a transom.
