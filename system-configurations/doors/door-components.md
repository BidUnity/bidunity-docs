# Door Components

Door Components are similar to regular Components \(used in a product validation\), but are meant only to be used in a door frame or door leaf. Each door component can be configured to include parts, but parts are not always necessary. Door components can have a different price for different door opening sizes. For example, a door jamb might be $100 for an 84" door, but $120 for a 96" door.
