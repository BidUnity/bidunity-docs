# Projects

**Project Overview:** Our idea of a project is pretty much the same as yours. All projects are different, so BidUnity requires that each individual project must have a unique name. There can be multiple different projects at the same address, but we will let you know when a new project's address matches an existing project's address. When everyone on your team is on the same page, it is much easier to coordinate your bidding efforts and avoid duplicate bidding.

**Project Statuses:** Projects go through different stages over their lifetime. BidUnity tracks those stages from a glazing contractor's perspective and updates them in the background. When you click on the projects link in the navigation bar notice that you bring up a list of 'open' projects. If you can't find the project you're looking for there, it might have been closed. Try looking at 'all' projects, notice the link above the open projects list, which will include your closed projects.

**Documents:** You can attach files to projects. BidUnity requires that you classify the documents by assigning a document type, it will help BidUnity to understand how the information should be distributed later. For example, if you attached architectural drawings, you will probably be relieved when your installers can access them from the field, but it might not be relevant to their work for installers to review the quotes received from project suppliers.

**Notes:** This feature functions as a sort of project blog. You can create permanent, internal records as the project progresses. Notes are not shared with other firms, but everyone at your firm will have the ability to view them.

**Proposals:** We'll discuss proposals seperately, but here we want to point out how a project organizes proposals. Proposals rigidly organize scopes of work. When you finalize a proposal it cannot be changed by anyone. That would be fairly inconvenient given how often customers change their minds, but BidUnity makes it super easy to copy and revise or to import parts of different proposals. You can't do this across projects, only within the same project.  
 Lets understand how this happens beneath the surface. When proposals are duplicated, an exact copy is created. Note that the proposal's door schedule is copied along with the specifications and elevations when it is duplicated. In contrast, when specifications are imported from one proposal to another, only the specification and elevations are coppied. When those elevations have doors, it can spell trouble when you try to review the proposal. We consider it a bug and will get it fixed later, because it hasn't been a big issue, but how you know.
